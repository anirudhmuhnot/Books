On Page 5 the python code has an error 
(A space before Cumulative for sierradata and liberiadata and also a space at the end)
Attached python code here (which is the correct version)

On Page 12 (the second example of Quarterback records by age)
The program has few errors, I checked and corrected them.  The correct code is in qb_records_byage.py
